# CLFTimersComp

This code simulates two timers with resets. The value of the state after the jump is given by a minimizer of a function (V).

runsync.m %Initializes parameters, calls hybridsolver.m, and plots output for resets attempting to synchronize the timers
rundesync.m %Initializes parameters, calls hybridsolver.m, and plots output for resets attempting to desynchronize the timers
C.m % Flow Set 
f.m % Flow Map 
D.m % Jump Set 
g.m % Jump Map 

Code was built using Matlab 2015a. Other builds are untested.
